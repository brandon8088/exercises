# Docker installation

## Prerequisites

You have already completed all of the setup outlined [here]("../ubuntu_setup/README.md")

## Document conventions

- Arguments to terminal commands will be represented as [argument_name]. When you type in an argument do not include the square brackets unless explictly asked
- Every command is terminated with pressing enter. I won't show enter as something to be pressed
